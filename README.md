# PCA_LVQ_hybrid_ANN
A hybrid Neural Net for classifying iris data combining Principle Component Analysis with the Learning Vector Quantization algorithm

This approach is to simulate semi-supervised learning using two approaches:
1. Simple LVQ
2. Feature extraction using PCA, which is fed into an LVQ algorithm
